# JS To HTML

A simple executable Ruby gem built to simplify using the [dev tools debugger](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript) while working with Node.js. 

The `js2html` command takes a single argument, the JS file you wish to run in your browser. If a valid file path is provided, an HTML file containing a script tag linking to the JS file will be created in the current directory.

Usage:
```bash
$ js2html file_name.js
````
