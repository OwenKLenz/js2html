# JS To HTML

A simple executable Ruby gem that generates an HTML file that contains a script tag that loads a specified js file.

I built this to simplify the process of running simple front end JS exercises in the browser to gain quicker access to Chrome developer tools.

Usage:
```bash
$ js2html file_name.js # Generates an HTML file in the current directory with the same name as the js file used as an argument
````
